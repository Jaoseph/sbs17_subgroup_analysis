## Description
A repository containing the workflow used for assigning single based substitution 17a and 17b subgroups to Esophageal Adenocarcinoma samples using a likelihood based mutational signature appraoch, followed by downstream genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical analyses. 

## Data
Reference data used for the analysis will be located within the /data folder.

## Code
The scripts that are used for both the the subgroups assignment and downstream analysis is located within the /script folder. 

### Mutational signature subgroup assignment 
Scripts are found in 
- /ICGC_Naive_clustering
- /ICGC_Treated_clustering
- /OCCAMS_Barretts_clustering
- /Combined_classification

*For reference for the likelihood method approach, please refer to https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-023-01239-7*

### Downstream mutational signature and genomic analyses
Scripts are found in 
- /DeconstructSigs-runs
- /Mutational_Signature_Analyses
- /Genomic_Analyses

### Downstream transcriptional analyses
Scripts are found in 
- /Transcriptional_Analyses

### Downstream clinical analyses
Scripts are found in
